Sokoban game in python with simple solver built on David Moreno's sokoban code.

Key         Action
←↑↓→    Move worker left, up, down, right
n/p     Next/previous level
N/P     Next/previous unsolved level
>/<     Next/previous world
q       Quit
r       Re-start
s       If no solution, solve from the current state.
S       Solve from the initial state, even if a solution has been found. While the solver is running:
            space   pause solve
            esc     exit solve
R       Replay solution
u/U     Undo/Re-do
mouse   Move worker to specified square; can push box adjacent to worker

Debug
^a      display annotated_map
^d      toggle DEBUG flag; DEBUG==True prints debug messages during solve()
^h      print heuristic
^m      print move_count_maps
^n      print neighbors
^s      print solution string
